# Cart Pricing Issue Fix

## Problem Description
Some users experienced all products in cart showing 0 euro pricing while quantity selectors were not working. The total price remained correct, but individual product prices displayed as zero.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by **multiple problems**:
1. A global template override in `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` that replaced the default cart item renderer for ALL products
2. **Price-based logic** in plugins that incorrectly treated regular products as loyalty products when `$item->getPrice()` returned 0 during frontend rendering (even though backend price was correct)
3. **QuoteItemPriceProtectionPlugin** blocking legitimate price modifications from other modules, causing conflicts
4. **JavaScript files using price-based detection** that treated any product with $0 display price as a loyalty product, interfering with regular product display

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Global Template Override
- **File**: `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml`
- **Change**: Removed the global template override that was affecting all cart items
- **Impact**: Regular products now use Magento's default price rendering

### 2. Fixed Plugin Logic (CRITICAL FIX)
- **File**: `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php`
- **Change**: Removed problematic price check `(float)$item->getPrice() == 0` that was causing regular products to be treated as loyalty products
- **Impact**: Only products with explicit `loyalty_locked_qty` option are now treated as loyalty products

### 3. Fixed ViewModel Logic
- **File**: `ViewModel/CartItemHelper.php`
- **Change**: Removed the same problematic price check from the ViewModel
- **Impact**: Consistent logic across all components

### 4. **REMOVED QuoteItemPriceProtectionPlugin (NEW FIX)**
- **File**: `Plugin/QuoteItemPriceProtectionPlugin.php` - **DELETED**
- **Change**: Completely removed the plugin that was blocking price modifications
- **Impact**: Eliminates conflicts with other modules (discount modules, tax modules, B2B pricing, etc.)
- **Registration**: Removed from `etc/di.xml`

### 5. **Fixed QuoteItemQtyValidatorPlugin (CRITICAL FIX)**
- **File**: `Plugin/QuoteItemQtyValidatorPlugin.php`
- **Change**: **MAJOR REFACTOR** - Changed from `aroundValidate` to `beforeValidate` method
- **Root Cause**: The `aroundValidate` method was intercepting ALL quote item validation, interfering with regular product price calculations
- **Solution**: `beforeValidate` only modifies loyalty products before validation, then allows normal Magento validation to proceed for ALL products
- **Impact**: Regular products now go through normal Magento validation without interference, loyalty products still have quantity protection

### 6. **Fixed JavaScript Price-Based Detection (NEW FIX)**
- **Files**: 
  - `view/frontend/web/js/loyalty-cart-observer.js`
  - `view/frontend/web/js/luma-qty-fix.js`
- **Change**: Removed price-based detection logic that was treating any product with $0 display price as loyalty product
- **Old Logic**: `if ((priceFound && price === 0) || isLocked)`
- **New Logic**: `if (isLocked)` - Only check `data-loyalty-locked-qty` attribute
- **Impact**: JavaScript no longer interferes with regular product price display

### 7. Deprecated Custom Template
- **File**: `view/frontend/templates/cart/item/default.phtml`
- **Change**: Marked as deprecated since it's no longer used globally
- **Impact**: Can be safely removed in future versions

## Files Modified
1. `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` - Removed global override
2. `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php` - **CRITICAL**: Removed price-based loyalty detection
3. `ViewModel/CartItemHelper.php` - **CRITICAL**: Removed price-based loyalty detection  
4. `Plugin/QuoteItemPriceProtectionPlugin.php` - **DELETED**: Removed entirely to prevent conflicts
5. `Plugin/QuoteItemQtyValidatorPlugin.php` - **CRITICAL**: Changed from `aroundValidate` to `beforeValidate` to prevent interference with regular product pricing
6. `etc/di.xml` - Removed QuoteItemPriceProtectionPlugin registration
7. `view/frontend/web/js/loyalty-cart-observer.js` - **CRITICAL**: Removed price-based detection from JavaScript
8. `view/frontend/web/js/luma-qty-fix.js` - **CRITICAL**: Removed price-based detection from JavaScript
9. `view/frontend/templates/cart/item/default.phtml` - Deprecated template

## Testing Instructions

### Before Testing
1. Clear Magento cache: `bin/magento cache:clean`
2. Recompile if needed: `bin/magento setup:di:compile`

### Test Cases
1. **Regular Products Only**: Add regular products to cart - prices should display correctly
2. **Loyalty Products Only**: Add loyalty products to cart - quantities should be locked, prices show as 0
3. **Mixed Cart**: Add both regular and loyalty products - regular products show prices, loyalty products locked
4. **Quantity Changes**: Try changing quantities - should work for regular products, locked for loyalty products

### Expected Results
- ✅ Regular products display correct prices
- ✅ Loyalty products show locked quantities
- ✅ Total cart price remains accurate
- ✅ Quantity selectors work for regular products
- ✅ Quantity selectors disabled for loyalty products

## Rollback Instructions
If issues occur, restore the original files:
1. Restore `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` with the original template override
2. Restore `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php` to original version
3. Clear cache

## Technical Notes
- The fix uses a plugin-based approach instead of global template overrides
- Only loyalty-specific items are affected by the custom logic
- Regular Magento cart functionality remains unchanged
- The solution is backward compatible and doesn't break existing functionality
