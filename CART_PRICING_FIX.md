# Cart Pricing Issue Fix

## Problem Description
Some users experienced all products in cart showing 0 euro pricing while quantity selectors were not working. The total price remained correct, but individual product prices displayed as zero.

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a global template override in `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` that replaced the default cart item renderer for ALL products, not just loyalty products. The custom template only handled quantity locking logic but didn't include proper price rendering for regular products.

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Removed Global Template Override
- **File**: `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml`
- **Change**: Removed the global template override that was affecting all cart items
- **Impact**: Regular products now use Magento's default price rendering

### 2. Enhanced Plugin Functionality
- **File**: `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php`
- **Change**: Enhanced the existing plugin to handle both quantity locking and JavaScript functionality
- **Impact**: Loyalty products still have locked quantities while regular products function normally

### 3. Deprecated Custom Template
- **File**: `view/frontend/templates/cart/item/default.phtml`
- **Change**: Marked as deprecated since it's no longer used globally
- **Impact**: Can be safely removed in future versions

## Files Modified
1. `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` - Removed global override
2. `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php` - Enhanced plugin functionality
3. `view/frontend/templates/cart/item/default.phtml` - Deprecated template

## Testing Instructions

### Before Testing
1. Clear Magento cache: `bin/magento cache:clean`
2. Recompile if needed: `bin/magento setup:di:compile`

### Test Cases
1. **Regular Products Only**: Add regular products to cart - prices should display correctly
2. **Loyalty Products Only**: Add loyalty products to cart - quantities should be locked, prices show as 0
3. **Mixed Cart**: Add both regular and loyalty products - regular products show prices, loyalty products locked
4. **Quantity Changes**: Try changing quantities - should work for regular products, locked for loyalty products

### Expected Results
- ✅ Regular products display correct prices
- ✅ Loyalty products show locked quantities
- ✅ Total cart price remains accurate
- ✅ Quantity selectors work for regular products
- ✅ Quantity selectors disabled for loyalty products

## Rollback Instructions
If issues occur, restore the original files:
1. Restore `view/frontend/layout/checkout_cart_item_renderers.xml` with the original template override
2. Restore `Plugin/CheckoutCartItemRendererPlugin.php` to original version
3. Clear cache

## Technical Notes
- The fix uses a plugin-based approach instead of global template overrides
- Only loyalty-specific items are affected by the custom logic
- Regular Magento cart functionality remains unchanged
- The solution is backward compatible and doesn't break existing functionality
